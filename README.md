# BLE_Provisioning
WiFi web server with BLE provisioning

Basically, it starts with ble and ask you the ssid and pasword you can use any app to provide ssid and pass because there is no encryption in the provisionig. After provsion it will connect to that particular wifi and open up a web server at particular ip address but you won't know which ip because by then ble stops when it connects to wifi. You can see ip of webserver on serial terminal or you can assing a static ip.
